# simple-notes-app-b4ae180c

This project is a minimalist notes app for Android, with offline support using Room and optional Supabase backend integration.

To use Supabase in code, make sure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` environment variables are set on your device/emulator or inject via SharedPreferences under the key names `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
